```r
read_1 <- "CGCGCAGTAGGGCACATGCCAGGTGTCCGCCACTTGGTGGGCACACAGCCGATGACGAACGGGCTCCTTGACTATAATCTGACCCGTTTGCGTTTGGGTGACCAGGGAGAACTGGTGCTCCTGC"
read_2 <- "AAAAAGCCAACCGAGAAATCCGCCAAGCCTGGCGACAAGAAGCCAGAGCAGAAGAAGACTGCTGCGGCTCCCGCTGCCGGCAAGAAGGAGGCTGCTCCCTCGGCTGCCAAGCCAGCTGCCGCTG"

**Question 1. what species are these sequences from?**\
*D. melanogaster*

_____

**Question 2. Put all three of these reads into a single object (a vector).  What class will the vector `reads` be? Check to make sure! How many characters are in each read (and why does `length()` not give you what you want.. try...)**\

```r
reads <- c(read_1, read_2, read_3)
class(reads)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
length(reads)
```

```
## [1] 3
```
Reads only returns the number of items in the vector not the length of the strings in each item of the vector.

_____

**Question 3. Say we wanted to print each character (not the full string) from read_1, how do we do this using a for loop? You may wish to look at a function like `strsplit()` to accomplish this (there are other ways.)**\
Replace the blanks.

```r
read_1_split <- strsplit(read_1, split = "", fixed = T) 
print(read_1_split)
```

```
## [[1]]
##   [1] "C" "G" "C" "G" "C" "A" "G" "T" "A" "G" "G" "G" "C" "A" "C" "A" "T"
##  [18] "G" "C" "C" "A" "G" "G" "T" "G" "T" "C" "C" "G" "C" "C" "A" "C" "T"
##  [35] "T" "G" "G" "T" "G" "G" "G" "C" "A" "C" "A" "C" "A" "G" "C" "C" "G"
##  [52] "A" "T" "G" "A" "C" "G" "A" "A" "C" "G" "G" "G" "C" "T" "C" "C" "T"
##  [69] "T" "G" "A" "C" "T" "A" "T" "A" "A" "T" "C" "T" "G" "A" "C" "C" "C"
##  [86] "G" "T" "T" "T" "G" "C" "G" "T" "T" "T" "G" "G" "G" "T" "G" "A" "C"
## [103] "C" "A" "G" "G" "G" "A" "G" "A" "A" "C" "T" "G" "G" "T" "G" "C" "T"
## [120] "C" "C" "T" "G" "C"
```

_____
**Question 4. What kind of object does this return? How might we make it a character vector again?**\

```r
class(read_1_split)
```

```
## [1] "list"
```
This returns a `list` object.

```r
read_1_vec <- unlist(read_1_split)
class(read_1_vec)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
_____
**Question 5. How about if we wanted the number of occurrences of each base? Or better yet, their frequencies? You could write a loop, but I suggest looking at the help for the `table()` function... Also keep in mind that for for most objects `length()` tells you how many elements there are in a vector. For lists use `lengths()` (so you can either do this on a character vector or a list, your choice)**\

```r
print(table(read_1_split)/lengths(read_1_split), digits = 2)
```

```
## read_1_split
##    A    C    G    T 
## 0.19 0.28 0.32 0.21
```
_____
**Question 6. How would you make this into a nice looking function that can work on either  a list or vectors of characters? (Still just for a single read)**\

```r
count <- function(x) {
  if (class(x) == "character") {
    table <- table(x)/length(x)
  } else if (class(x) == "list") {
    unlist(x)
    table <- table(x)/lengths(x)
  } else {
    print("Invalid data type")
  }
  return(table)
}
print(count(read_1_split), digits = 2)
```

```
## x
##    A    C    G    T 
## 0.19 0.28 0.32 0.21
```

```r
print(count(read_1_vec), digits = 2)
```

```
## x
##    A    C    G    T 
## 0.19 0.28 0.32 0.21
```
_____
**Question 7. Now how can you modify your approach to do it for an arbitrary numbers of reads? You could use a loop or use one of the apply like functions (which one)?**\

```r
count_2 <- function(x) {
  if (class(x) == "character" & length(x) == 1) {
    x <- strsplit(x, split = "", fixed = T) 
    x <- unlist(x)
    table <- table(x)/length(x)
  } else if (class(x) == "character" & length(x) != 1) {
    table <- table(x)/length(x)
    } else if (class(x) == "list") {
    unlist(x)
    table <- table(x)/length(x)
  } else {
    print("Invalid data type")
  }
  return(table)
}
print(sapply(reads, count_2, USE.NAMES = F), digits = 2)
```

```
##   [,1]  [,2]  [,3]
## A 0.19 0.274 0.081
## C 0.28 0.331 0.331
## G 0.32 0.298 0.347
## T 0.21 0.097 0.242
```
_____
**Question 8. Can you revise your function so that it can handle the input of either a string as a single multicharacter vector, *or* a vector of individual characters *or* a list? Try it out with the vector of three sequence reads (`reads`).**\

```r
count_3 <- function(x) {
  if (class(x) == "character" & length(x) == 1) {
    x <- strsplit(x, split = "", fixed = T) 
    x <- unlist(x)
    table <- table(x)/length(x)
  } else if (class(x) == "character" & length(x) != 1) {
      for (item in x) {
        if (length(item) == 1) {
          split <- strsplit(x, split = "", fixed = T)
          table <- table(split)/length(split)
        } else {
           table <- table(x)/length(x)
        }
      }
    } else if (class(x) == "list") {
    unlist(x)
    table <- table(x)/length(x)
  } else {
    print("Invalid data type")
  }
  return(table)
}
print(count_3(reads), digits = 2)
```
